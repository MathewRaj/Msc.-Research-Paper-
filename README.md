This repository has been created  to showcase the Research paper submitted in the field of Machine learning and Deep learning. 

An Expert Advisor Using GRU : 

This research paper mainly discusses about time series forecasting by one of the most effective neural network deep learning models. These models are trained by obtaining historical data. 

We have used the US Dollar against the Canadian Dollar pair on a 5minute time interval. We have trained and tested it on a GRU model with 10k data points which has four inputs (open ,high, low, close prices) and one output ( close price).

Strategy : 
Buy/Sell strategy  is based on two technical indicators: Bollinger Bands and the Stoichastic RSI.
